## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
      
      - Vehicle Length, Ground Clearance and also intercept.
      
- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
      
      - Slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero since the p-value of this linear regression is 5.08 X 10 <sup>-8</sup>. Which is much smaller than our assumed significance level of 0.05%

- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
     
      - R-sqaured value is 0.71 which means there is roughly 71% of the variablilty of our dependent variable and that is considered a good for the analysis.
